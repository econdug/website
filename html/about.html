                    <p class="header-preview">
                        For the 2022-23 academic year, the Economics DUG is seeking to foster diversity, inclusivity, and
                        connectivity. From a diversity perspective, this includes the ongoing pursuit of creating and
                        sustaining an inclusive environment that empowers both DUG members and all members of the
                        Economics community to learn about and have access to resources that facilitate personal and
                        professional growth. Additionally, DUG members will have the support to take ownership of their
                        respective committees and explore topics and ideas about which they are passionate, ultimately
                        diversifying the types of events the DUG hosts. From an inclusivity perspective, this includes
                        promoting opportunities for students to be continuously involved in and engaged with the
                        Department of Economics--in addition to standard DUG events. Finally, it is the DUG’s priority
                        to promote connectivity within the DUG, the student body, and the broader Providence community,
                        creating opportunities for students to engage in meaningful interaction with each other and the
                        Department, whether that be through socials, mentorship opportunities, and more.
