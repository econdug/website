In this project, we quantify racial bias of a particular form: Does differential relatability to content within reading passages contribute to racial test gaps? Using data from Texas, we find that content relatability is (a) predictive of student outcomes and (b) accounts for a small, yet significant portion of racial test gaps for Black and Hispanic students.
